### Sentiment Analysis on Steam Game Review using RoBERTa: Does Sarcasm Matter?

## Abstract:
Sentiment analysis on customer reviews is a widely used Natural Language Processing(NLP) application. However, some types of reviews, such as video game reviews, might contain sarcasm, which makes the traditional NLP model less than ideal. This paper aims to explore the state-of-the-art RoBERTa modelâ€™s performance on the "Steam Review Dataset", which Steam is one of the biggest online video distributor. Also, four Fine-Tuned versions of the RoBERTa model using this specific dataset are tested. The performance of the Fine-Tuned model does improve over the base RoBERTa model and gives a more balanced result. On the other hand, the manual analysis of this paper suggests that although Fine-Tuned Roberta models achieve higher performance, they are not directly associated with the improvement to counter the effect of sarcasm.
